        <p>Hammer stolen off of google images, I am pretty sure it was listed on amazon at some point. The handle is made of plastic with more rubber on the end to allow it to grip better. Also the head is bent, I am not sure why they made it this way but it is really hard to hit nails with the thin side</p>
